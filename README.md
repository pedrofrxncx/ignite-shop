## Getting Started

This application was created for a quick test of the Stripe API. To run it locally, follow the instructions:

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, create a .env.local file with values for:
```
NEXT_URL='yourappurl'
# and
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY='yourkeyhere'
# and
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY='yourkeyhere'
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
